### 3.1 Issues
Any new issues will be looked at and evaluated for validity of a bug or for the usefulness of a suggested feature. If we have questions about your issue we will get back as soon as we can (usually in a day or two) and will try to make a decision within a week.
**Great Issue suggestions** tend to have:

- A quick summary of the changes.
- In case of any bug provide steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
  - What you expected would happen
  - What actually happens
  - Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

Pull requests are evaluated by their quality and how effectively they solve their corresponding issue. The process for reviewing pull requests is as follows:

1. A pull request is submitted
2. We will review and test the pull request (usually within a week)
3. After we approve your pull request:
    * If your pull request is considered an improvement or enhancement the project owner will have 1 day to veto or approve your pull request.
    * If your pull request is considered a new feature the project owner will have 1 week to veto or approve your pull request.
4. If any feedback is given we expect a response within 1 week or we may decide to close the PR.
